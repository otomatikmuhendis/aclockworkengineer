[Guru99](https://www.guru99.com) is a website worth to mention. Their comprehensive tutorials contain beautifully annotated screenshots. Their goal is to provide fun and free education for everyone.

Sometimes I prefer video tutorials but they can be time consuming so a source like this is more accesible with its content.

I could only check out their amazing [JUnit tutorials](https://www.guru99.com/junit-tutorial.html) for one of my posts called [Attributes and Annotations of Testing Frameworks](https://olcay.dev/2016/10/09/test-framework-attribute-annotation/). As a blog writer I can see their effort in it.

The JUnit course covers;
- JUnit Basics like Introduction, Test framework, Download and Install Guide
- Introduces Junit Annotation, API, Assert and JUnit Test Suite
- Advanced topics like Ignore Test, Exception Test, ErrorCollector and Parameterized Test
