[Paul Hallett](https://github.com/phalt) developed a web api called [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/) which consists of the data from the universe of Star Wars.

You can find all the planets, spaceships, vehicles, characters from the six original movies. This is a nice dataset to practice coding or for an assessment. I wrote an api client [SharpTrooper](https://github.com/olcay/SharpTrooper) with C# to support this project in 2015. You know Storm Troopers are famous with their lack of targeting skills.

Thanks to Paul, he shared my library in [the documents](https://swapi.dev/documentation#csharp). A few developers from Github and Microsoft starred the repository. I forgot about it until [Matt Fricker](https://github.com/matfricker) sent me a pull-request with some updates. Apparently, the service was moved from swapi.co to swapi.dev.
