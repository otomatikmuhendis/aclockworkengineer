We experienced a year like never before. I tried to do what I could and stayed at home as much as possible while keeping my health and sanity well. I focused on self development and sharing the knowledge with others. Thanks to all healthcare and essential workers, they made it possible to do the stuff in the list below;

* Finished an awesome course [Harvard Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/certificates/181b84e8-4ac7-4c4c-afad-0828eedb1d60). It was mostly back to basics for me but a lot of fun and a few nice little details in programming. There are some updates in the course so I think I will do it again.

* Wrote 6 new blog posts as you can see below. It is not much but still better than previous years.

* Organized an online meetup [Hacktoberfest Istanbul](https://organize.mlh.io/participants/events/5678-hacktoberfest-istanbul). I always wanted to do it but I was far from the community. I did not miss the chance to make it online.

* Recorded a mini documentary about The Apollo Guidance Computer; [Apollo 11](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0mZfCNyS3Y-5LWGSVbomcRFnGtq5cYLK). When a developer encounters some challenge, it is common to say that "It is not rocket science." so I just wanted to see rocket science. Rocket science is not rocket science.

* Passed 2 Microsoft exams [Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/8635bcff-9ace-46a3-9f81-b25f732e37aa/public_url). At the end of the year I just gave my knowledge a try with Microsoft exams and I could pass it with little preparation because I was already working on Azure for years. After passing the first one, I started to study for the second one and it was looking tougher. I passed it on the first try as well. I can write another post about how I prepared for those exams.
