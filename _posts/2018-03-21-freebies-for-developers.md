I have built my first websites on free hosting services like GeoCities and Tripod. I like to apply what I learned and the main purpose of these kind of free services is providing an environment to try our new skills.

Generally they limit their target area to students but you can be a student at any age. Life-long learning is our motto of life right? After all those engineering bachelor and master's, I am still a student of photography and cameraman.

### Github Student Pack

You can access to this package on https://education.github.com/pack address and I think it is the most comprehensive one. The list is changing with the time but it still has a wide range of products. I suggest you to try all of them.

### Microsoft Imagine (previously Dreamspark)

You can see the full product catalog on https://imagine.microsoft.com/en-us/catalog website. It is for generally Microsoft products with a range from tutorials to operating systems.

### JetBrains

This was in the Github Student Pack list before. Now, you can through their webpage on https://www.jetbrains.com/student/ link. If you are a strudent then you can get a JetBrains certificate for every usefull product of JetBrains like ReSharper and WebStorm.
