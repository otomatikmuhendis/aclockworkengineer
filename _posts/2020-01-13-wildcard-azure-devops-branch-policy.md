We use [GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) as our branching model on Azure Devops. When we create a new Release branch, we want it to be protected by default. By protection I mean, preventing unreviewed code changes.

This is not like setting a branch policy for an existing branch, it would be a wildcard for future branches. You need to do one extra step to access the correct page for a wildcard and this is not documented yet.

<!--more-->

1. Go to Branches page under Repos on Azure Devops.
1. If you already have a folder in your repo, you can skip to step 5.
1. Click __New branch__ and fil in the name like _release/tempBranch_.
1. Click __Create__.
1. Click __â‹® (vertical ellipsis)__ next to a folder.

1. Select __Branch policies__ in the menu.
1. It will redirect to the branch policies page with the title _Branch policies for {folderName}/*_.
1. Here you can set the policies.
1. After setting the policies in place you can remove the _tempBranch_ if you created one.

The existing or future branches which matches the wildcard will be using the policies.
