[Tinycards](https://tinycards.duolingo.com/) is a new mobile application from the creators of [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com) which is led by [Luis von Ahn](https://www.ted.com/talks/luis_von_ahn_massive_scale_online_collaboration)

The app helps to memorize anything with its simple UX. It has the same simplicty while creating a deck of  flashcards. We have published some decks as A Clockwork Engineer which you can find on [https://tiny.cards/users/olcaybayram](https://tiny.cards/users/olcaybayram). First, you should [download the app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1109425556?pt=1374442&ct=Web%20preview&mt=8) to commence and it is free but it is only for iOS right now.

Decks;

- HTTP Verbs & Status Codes
- Git Commands

It is not focused on languages like the similar applications like [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/). Memrise has various categories but they don't show them in the first place.
