_For all those companies which are in the middle of agile transformation or transformed already._

As software developers, we have another manifesto that raises the bar a little bit higher over [Agile Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/), that is called [Software Craftsmanship](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) and signed by same people who wrote Agile manifesto.

We should start from definitions to understand anything so let's examine Software Craftsmanship word by word.

### Craft
A craft is a profession that requires particular skills and knowledge of skilled work. Software Development is our profession so it is our craft.

### Craftsmanship
Craftsmanship is our journey and we can define our journey like;

Once an **apprentice** of a craft had finished her apprenticeship, 
she would become a **journeyman** searching for a place to set up her own shop and make a living.
After she set up her own shop, she could then call herself a **master** of her craft.

### Well-Crafted Software
It is about building a culture for passionate, disciplined and motivated people who aims to write well-crafted software and continuously deliver value.

**Work done != Well-crafted**

**Master work == Well-crafted**

Work done can seize the day for any startup but if you want to erupt your structure on good foundations than you must master your work in the same time interval you make your work done.

To master your work be responsible of...

- Design
- Architecture
- Quality
- Testing
- Security
- Performance
- Maintenance
- Operations
- Practices
