As software developers, we need to know any software vulnerability to prevent them before they happen. Every software developer should act or think like a hacker at some point. It is like asking what would a thief do to infiltrate our house and taking precautions. On the other side, hackers are evolving. They are getting better and faster tools.

Karen from comparitech has contacted me about her colleague's article about ethical hacking by using Python. Please, have a look at this [6 best online courses for ethical hackers](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/hacking-python-courses-online/) guide. It has a wide range of courses even including one for non-coders.
